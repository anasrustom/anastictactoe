        <div class = "content"><p>When deciding to make a project to test my coding ability, I did not want to make a normal tic tac toe game, I wanted it to have a twist. I didn't want the program to be a two-player and I wanted it to always win, even if the human player is starting first.
            A impossible tic-tac-toe game is often programmed more effiently with a function called minimax (A form of artifical intelligence where it minimizes any tendency to lose a game while maximizing any opportunity to win the game)
            However, I did not have enough experience and knowledge in programming in order to build it using minimax, so I hardcoded it and used if statements in a sequence where it minimizes most potentional combinations by consistently
            preforming attacking moves to finish the game sooner. In the 3x3 grid of Tic Tac Toe, there are exactly 19,683 possible combinations (taking into account the symmetry of the game) and I was able to complete the program 
            that has absolutely no tender spots using around 500 lines of code in JavaScript. The entire project took me around 6 hours to complete, including the HTML and CSS, as it was completely from scratch. However, I did get stuck
            at the click function and the reset button so I had to use online resources in order to learn how to create them while fitting into my project. Overall, I found it as a learning experience but I really believe I could've been able to code it in a more efficent manner
            so I hope to continue learning in order to enhance and sharpen my programming skill set. - Anas Rustom </p> </div>
